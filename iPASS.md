CIA Triad: confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

### Confidentiality 

Confidentiality refers to an organizationâ€™s efforts to keep their data private or secret.

Typically, this involves ensuring that only those who are authorized have access to specific assets and that those who are unauthorized are actively prevented from obtaining access.

### Integrity

In everyday usage, integrity refers to the quality of something being whole or complete.

In InfoSec, integrity is about ensuring that data has not been tampered with and, therefore, can be trusted. It is correct, authentic, and reliable.

### Availability

Systems, applications, and data are of little value to an organization and its customers if they are not accessible when authorized users need them.

Quite simply, availability means that networks, systems, and applications are up and running. It ensures that authorized users have timely, reliable access to resources when they are needed.
